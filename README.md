# FlixHarbor: A Movie Recommendation Systemüé¨üçø

## Overview

Welcome to **FlixHarbor** - your go-to destination for discovering exciting movies tailored just for you! FlixHarbor is a content-based movie recommendation system that combines the best of both worlds, with half of its magic brewed in Jupyter Notebook and the other half enchanted in Visual Studio Code.

This project is a machine learning-based movie recommender system that suggests movies to consumers. To locate related movies, it makes use of the TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity. After the user enters their preferred film, the application suggests five more films that are comparable.

The project is carried out as an online programme. The user interface is straightforward and intuitive. The user only needs to input the title of their preferred film, and the application will suggest five titles that are comparable. The plot, characters, and genre of the films all play a part in the suggestions.

The project makes movie recommendations using a range of machine learning approaches. The movie descriptions must first be converted into vectors using TfidfVectorizer. Text can be converted into vectors using the TfidfVectorizer approach, which takes into account word importance and frequency.

After converting the movie descriptions into vectors, the software finds related movies by utilising cosine similarity. A metric for comparing the similarity of two vectors is cosine similarity. The degree of similarity between two vectors increases with the cosine similarity between them.

The project suggests movies to users based on the cosine similarity between the movie vectors. The project determines the five films that have the highest cosine resemblance to each user's preferred film. The user is then given the recommendation of these five films.
